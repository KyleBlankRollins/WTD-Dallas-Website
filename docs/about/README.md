Write the Docs | Dallas is a local Meetup under a family of Meetups and Conferences called Write the Docs (http://www.writethedocs.org/). WTD already exists in over two dozen cities, with global presence in many current and emerging tech centers, such as San Francisco, Portland, London, and Berlin.

WTD is an inclusive community with a code of conduct that prohibits harassment of any participant, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. Read the full code of conduct here: http://www.writethedocs.org/code-of-conduct/.

Whether it's print, web, or embedded documentation, come strategize with us. We'd love to hear your perspective on what makes for great documentation and how to get there.
